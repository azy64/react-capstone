# React Capstone: Metrics webapp

This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that we created making use of React and Redux.

We selected an API that provides numeric data about a topic that we like and then build the web app around it. The web app has several pages:

- one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters. An example can be a list of metrics that can be filtered by the country (imagine a search field to introduce the country name like Italy, Croatia, etc.). This page should be our homepage.
  
- one page for the item details; in the example, the detail page for Czech Republic cities with a number of views.
